## Combat Logger

A simple combat logger for minecraft servers with some extra pvp related features.

Reason of this plugin was I was tiered of bloated combat plugins that were bloated and still
missing features I wanted. If I am missing any features you want please open an issue or a PR.

### Features
- kills the player if they log out during combat 
- shows a bossbar when in combat 
- shows a message when entering and leaving combat
- item cooldowns related to pvp e.g. ender pearl, chorus fruit
- block cooldown and block decay
- towny support
- damage increaser for pvp
- banned items including non pvp.
- command prevention while in combat e.g. /home, /warp, /spawn
- travel bans while in combat e.g. elytra, horse, boat, minecart
- storage access prevention while in combat e.g. chests, enderchests

### TODO
- [ ] fix reloading command 
- [ ] remove debuff option
- [ ] fix trident bug
- [ ] support other claiming plugins

### Commands
- /combatlog reload - reloads the config
- /combatlog tag - tags the player who did the command for testing
